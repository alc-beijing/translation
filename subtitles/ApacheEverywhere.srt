1
00:00:04,90 --> 00:00:09,89
That somebody that they've used Apache software within the last hour.

2
00:00:10,00 --> 00:00:15,00
And they have they have because not only are particular projects

3
00:00:15,07 --> 00:00:20,06
particularly widespread, but the spread of projects is enormous.

4
00:00:20,10 --> 00:00:25,63
And so for instance, if they've used a credit card,

5
00:00:25,94 --> 00:00:31,09
if they've used television, if they've used a web browser, they use the laptop.

6
00:00:31,17 --> 00:00:34,69
It's almost certain that they've used some Apache software,

7
00:00:35,04 --> 00:00:39,69
not knowing it, not necessarily seeing it.

8
00:00:39,82 --> 00:00:41,38
But it's almost certainly there.

9
00:00:41,64 --> 00:00:45,06
And it's unless you've been asleep for the last eight hours,

10
00:00:45,21 --> 00:00:48,86
it's really, really hard to go in a modern technological sense,

11
00:00:49,10 --> 00:00:54,09
more than just a short period of time without using some Apache software.

12
00:00:54,28 --> 00:00:57,26
Why do we give it away? Because what we do.

13
00:00:57,40 --> 00:01:02,39
because the impact of open source is that openness.

14
00:01:03,36 --> 00:01:07,51
the ability for anyone to come and use and consume and contribute.

15
00:01:08,72 --> 00:01:14,91
Hundreds and hundreds of years where knowledge was used to generate money.

16
00:01:15,27 --> 00:01:22,76
And the only success factor in society is how much money is my company making.

17
00:01:23,12 --> 00:01:26,91
I think the ASF has proven that even without making money,

18
00:01:27,22 --> 00:01:33,53
we did have a humongous impact in the way which the world runs.

19
00:01:33,82 --> 00:01:35,69
What would have defined success?

20
00:01:35,84 --> 00:01:39,44
The project success is based on the people rather than the code.

21
00:01:39,77 --> 00:01:42,76
And that's pretty much what comes about by the Apache way,

22
00:01:42,98 --> 00:01:46,28
The community is far more important than the code.

23
00:01:46,35 --> 00:01:49,03
The code will survive whether or not the community does.

24
00:01:49,04 --> 00:01:51,93
But it won't get any better on being rich.

25
00:01:52,27 --> 00:01:57,26
They won't go on to succeed unless there's a community that is supported.

26
00:01:57,37 --> 00:01:59,44
One of the things we're seeing nowadays

27
00:01:59,57 --> 00:02:06,86
is that the lessons learned inside of IT as far as how to create successful open source projects.

28
00:02:07,17 --> 00:02:11,21
But most important, how to create successful open source communities,

29
00:02:11,25 --> 00:02:14,06
of which the apache way is most probably the best example of

30
00:02:14,12 --> 00:02:18,06
that is starting to make inroads in other areas.

31
00:02:18,34 --> 00:02:22,14
This excessive open source is gonna expand beyond IT

32
00:02:22,25 --> 00:02:27,74
is gonna expand beyond other software development in ecosystem.

33
00:02:28,07 --> 00:02:36,28
We're seeing open source cities now where the ideas of how to engage the populace,

34
00:02:36,57 --> 00:02:41,54
how to engage the citizens are using some of the tenants

35
00:02:41,67 --> 00:02:43,71
and some of the ideals of the apache way

36
00:02:43,84 --> 00:02:48,56
making sure that there is transparency in all the decision making processes of government.

37
00:02:48,82 --> 00:02:50,36
I this is how you build software,

38
00:02:50,62 --> 00:02:53,68
is by making sure that everyone involved both the people who are creating the software,

39
00:02:53,77 --> 00:02:57,43
who are creating the software, creating the laws,

40
00:02:57,52 --> 00:03:02,11
as well as the end users of the software and the citizens who were going to be abiding by the law.

41
00:03:02,12 --> 00:03:07,89
Is everything open? Everything is being done, an open, public, and transparent manner.

42
00:03:08,09 --> 00:03:11,83
So we're seeing a lot of the tenants of successful open source.

43
00:03:12,15 --> 00:03:18,66
A lot of the means of the Apache way transcend the IT community

44
00:03:18,97 --> 00:03:25,81
and make inroads into government, corporate entities, a heavy industry, manufacturing, machining.

45
00:03:26,05 --> 00:03:33,01
And I think that's an incredible heritage for the movement we've created.

46
00:03:33,32 --> 00:03:38,24
At the use cases that get me excited are the ones that are about trying to address

47
00:03:38,40 --> 00:03:42,06
any one of those two hundred and sixty different sustainable development goals out there right

48
00:03:42,07 --> 00:03:44,28
if we're going to have a carbon trading market

49
00:03:44,57 --> 00:03:48,18
we're going to need a distributed ledger system to be able to do that on a global scale

50
00:03:48,52 --> 00:03:54,49
if we're going to eliminate child labor in mines or on fishing boats or in other industries

51
00:03:54,80 --> 00:03:57,01
it's going to be through technologies like this.


52
00:03:57,32 --> 00:04:02,53
FIN act is a project that supports Micro finance institutions in giving out loans

53
00:04:02,94 --> 00:04:06,31
and and tracking savings for the poorest of the poor.

54
00:04:06,40 --> 00:04:11,41
So it's very rewarding to be able to make these services available to the poor.

55
00:04:11,59 --> 00:04:14,21
Because if you don't have savings, if you don't have loans,

56
00:04:14,34 --> 00:04:16,96
if you don't have remittances, that's money transfers

57
00:04:17,14 --> 00:04:20,93
then you don't have contact the global economy and you can't profit

58
00:04:21,14 --> 00:04:24,66
when your boat doesn't rise when everybody else's boat rises.

59
00:04:24,85 --> 00:04:27,21
In the case of this project, you're connecting the empowerment

60
00:04:27,42 --> 00:04:31,86
are the poorest of the poor with the empowerment of other software developers.

61
00:04:32,13 --> 00:04:35,04
And you're doing both of them in the context of a community.

62
00:04:35,55 --> 00:04:42,54
So it's really wonderful parallels between open source software and micro finance.

63
00:04:43,07 --> 00:04:47,29
Being part of that. It just gives me a great feeling

64
00:04:47,30 --> 00:04:50,24
that we've been able to change the world for the better

65
00:04:50,44 --> 00:04:53,46
A lot of our software helps developing countries.

66
00:04:53,74 --> 00:05:00,51
The great strides the world has made today in the last 20 years of globalization,

67
00:05:00,87 --> 00:05:07,76
with the developing countries growing and advancing on providing  better living conditions

68
00:05:08,00 --> 00:05:12,63
and better economic advancement for its populations

69
00:05:12,72 --> 00:05:15,43
That's a result of the Free software movements.

70
00:05:15,75 --> 00:05:19,09
And Apache had a big hand in that.

71
00:05:19,10 --> 00:05:20,01
I feel very strongly.

72
00:05:20,27 --> 00:05:24,09
The only thing that will save us as a species from our own internal greed

73
00:05:24,44 --> 00:05:29,18
and hatred and the distance that we put between human hearts.

74
00:05:29,42 --> 00:05:33,96
And I occasionally I'm chided because I am very sensitive person  and have thin skin.

75
00:05:34,10 --> 00:05:37,09
And they say, you need thicker skin.

76
00:05:37,35 --> 00:05:41,09
Now thicker skin puts more distance between human hearts.

77
00:05:41,35 --> 00:05:44,38
It allows more space for not like me.

78
00:05:44,62 --> 00:05:47,84
 It allows more space for us versus them.

79
00:05:48,05 --> 00:05:54,01
And that will be our undoing, not just as technologists but as a species.

80
00:05:54,36 --> 00:05:59,86
And we are at a crucial point in our evolution, I believe,

81
00:06:00,02 --> 00:06:04,13
where we need to start caring more about each other and less about profit.

82
00:06:04,39 --> 00:06:08,23
And the Apache way voices one part of that,

83
00:06:08,37 --> 00:06:10,36
I think in a very powerful way.

84
00:06:10,52 --> 00:06:15,51
When we put community above code,

85
00:06:15,60 --> 00:06:18,61
that gives us the opportunity to have a place

86
00:06:18,69 --> 00:06:23,41
where people can be passionate about solving other people's problems.

87
00:06:23,57 --> 00:06:28,56
That is one element of good empathy.
