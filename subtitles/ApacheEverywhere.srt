1
00:00:04,90 --> 00:00:09,89
Bet somebody that they've used Apache software within the last hour.
我敢打赌，刚才肯定有人在使用 Apache 软件

2
00:00:10,00 --> 00:00:15,00
And they have, they have. Because not only are particular projects
结果也确实如此，不仅仅是因为特定的项目

3
00:00:15,07 --> 00:00:20,06
particularly widespread, but the spread of projects is enormous.
特别受欢迎，还因为 Apache 项目影响深远

4
00:00:20,10 --> 00:00:25,63
And so for instance, if they've used a credit card,
举例来说，如果使用信用卡，

5
00:00:25,94 --> 00:00:31,09
if they've used television, if they've used a web browser, they've used a laptop.
看电视，浏览网页，用电脑

6
00:00:31,17 --> 00:00:34,69
It's almost certain that they've used some Apache software,
这些都会和 Apache 软件有关

7
00:00:35,04 --> 00:00:39,69
not knowing it, not necessarily seeing it.
只是你没意识到而已。

8
00:00:39,82 --> 00:00:41,38
But it's almost certainly there.
但它们（Apache软件）一定是在那里的。

9
00:00:41,64 --> 00:00:45,06
And it's unless you've been asleep for the last eight hours,
除非过去的几个小时，你一直在睡觉

10
00:00:45,21 --> 00:00:48,86
it's really, really hard to go in a modern technological sense,
只要你和现代科技打交道

11
00:00:49,10 --> 00:00:54,09
more than just a short period of time without using some Apache software.
哪怕只是很短的时间，你都会用到 Apache 软件。

12
00:00:54,28 --> 00:00:57,26
Why do we give it away? Because it is what we do.
我们为什么将它们“拱手送人”？因为这就是我们要做的。

13
00:00:57,40 --> 00:01:02,39
because the impact of open source is that openness.
因为开源本身的影响力就在于开放。

14
00:01:03,36 --> 00:01:07,51
the ability for anyone to come and use and consume and contribute.
Apache 就是要让大家都来使用、消费并贡献

15
00:01:08,72 --> 00:01:14,91
Hundreds and hundreds of years where knowledge was used to generate money.
过去几千年，知识一直用来赚钱

16
00:01:15,27 --> 00:01:22,76
And the only success factor in society is how much money is my company making.
社会衡量成功的唯一标准就是你的公司赚了多少钱

17
00:01:23,12 --> 00:01:26,91
I think the ASF has proven that even without making money,
而 Apache 软件基金会向人们证明，即使不赚钱

18
00:01:27,22 --> 00:01:33,53
we did have a humongous impact in the way which the world runs.
我们也会给社会带来巨大的影响

19
00:01:33,82 --> 00:01:35,69
What would have defined success?
什么是成功？

20
00:01:35,84 --> 00:01:39,44
The project success is based on the people rather than the code.
项目的成功在于人，而不是代码

21
00:01:39,77 --> 00:01:42,76
And that's pretty much what comes about by the Apache way,
这就是 Apache 之道

22
00:01:42,98 --> 00:01:46,28
The community is far more important than the code.
社区远比代码重要。

23
00:01:46,35 --> 00:01:49,03
The code will survive whether or not the community does.
无论社区能否存活，代码都可以留存下来。

24
00:01:49,04 --> 00:01:51,93
But it won't get any better or be enriched.
但它一定不会变得更好或更丰富。

25
00:01:52,27 --> 00:01:57,26
They won't go on to succeed unless there's a community that support it.
除非有一个社区在背后支持它（们），否则它们不会持续发展下去

26
00:01:57,37 --> 00:01:59,44
One of the things we're seeing nowadays
如今，

27
00:01:59,57 --> 00:02:06,86
is that the lessons learned inside of IT，as far as how to create successful open source projects.
IT 界成功创造了一个又一个的开源项目，

28
00:02:07,17 --> 00:02:11,21
But most important, how to create successful open source communities,
更重要的是，打造了一个又一个的开源社区，这些大家有目共睹

29
00:02:11,25 --> 00:02:14,06
of which the apache way is most probably the best example of that 
在这点Apache之道或许是最成功的案例

30
00:02:14,12 --> 00:02:18,06
is starting to make inroads in other areas.

31
00:02:18,34 --> 00:02:22,14
This excessive open source is gonna expand beyond IT

32
00:02:22,25 --> 00:02:27,74
is gonna expand beyond other software development in ecosystem.
将扩张并超越生态中其他软件的发展。

33
00:02:28,07 --> 00:02:36,28
We're seeing open source cities now where the ideas of how to engage the populace,
我们可以看到开源的城市，在那里关于如何使全体居民参与

34
00:02:36,57 --> 00:02:41,54
how to engage the citizens are using some of the tenets

35
00:02:41,67 --> 00:02:43,71
and some of the ideals of the apache way

36
00:02:43,84 --> 00:02:48,56
making sure that there is transparency in all the decision making processes of government.
确保政府的所有决策过程都可以做到透明。

37
00:02:48,82 --> 00:02:50,36
I mean, this is how you build software,
这就是软件的开发模式

38
00:02:50,62 --> 00:02:53,68
is by making sure that everyone involve, both the people who are creating the software,
让大家都参与其中，无论是软件工程师、

39
00:02:53,77 --> 00:02:57,43
who are creating the software, creating the laws,
软件工程师、立法者

40
00:02:57,52 --> 00:03:02,11
as well as the end users of the software and the citizens who were going to be abiding by the law.
还是终端的软件用户和那些遵从法律的市民们。

41
00:03:02,12 --> 00:03:07,89
Is everything open? Everything is being done, in an open, public, and transparent manner.
是所有事情都是公开的吗？所有事情都是在一种公共的、开放的、透明的方式下完成的。

42
00:03:08,09 --> 00:03:11,83
So we're seeing a lot of the tenets of successful open source,
所以我们看到很多成功开源软件的信条。

43
00:03:12,15 --> 00:03:18,66
A lot of the means of the Apache way transcend the IT community,

44
00:03:18,97 --> 00:03:25,81
and make inroads into government, corporate entities, a heavy industry, manufacturing, machining.
并运用在政府、公司企业、重工业、工厂、机械领域中。

45
00:03:26,05 --> 00:03:33,01
And I think that's an incredible heritage for the movement we've created.
这笔遗产价值连城

46
00:03:33,32 --> 00:03:38,24
At the use cases that get me excited are the ones that are about trying to address
让我感到最激动实际案例，是哪些想要试图解决

47
00:03:38,40 --> 00:03:42,06
any one of those two hundred and sixty different sustainable development goals out there, right?
二百六十种可持续发展目之中任意一个的软件，对吧？

48
00:03:42,07 --> 00:03:44,28
if we're going to have a carbon trading market
如果我们要建立一个碳交易市场的话

49
00:03:44,57 --> 00:03:48,18
we're going to need a distributed ledger system to be able to do that on a global scale
我们就将需要一个分布式账本系统来在全球范围内实现这一点。

50
00:03:48,52 --> 00:03:54,49
if we're going to eliminate child labor in mines or on fishing boats or in other industries

51
00:03:54,80 --> 00:03:57,01
it's going to be through technologies like this.

53
00:04:02,94 --> 00:04:06,31
and and tracking savings for the poorest of the poor.

所以，能够让穷人享受到这些服务，是非常有意义的。

55
00:04:11,59 --> 00:04:14,21
Because if you don't have savings, if you don't have loans,

56
00:04:14,34 --> 00:04:16,96
if you don't have remittances, that's money transfers,

00:04:21,14 --> 00:04:24,66
when your boat doesn't rise when everybody else's boat rises.

59
00:04:24,85 --> 00:04:27,21
In the case of this project, you're connecting the empowerment
在这个项目中，你要把最贫困的人的赋能

60
00:04:27,42 --> 00:04:31,86
of the poorest of the poor with the empowerment of the software developers.
和软件开发者的赋能联系起来。

61
00:04:32,13 --> 00:04:35,04
And you're doing both of them in the context of a community.

62
00:04:35,55 --> 00:04:42,54
So there are really wonderful parallels between open source software and micro finance.
所以，开源软件和小微金融之间真的有奇妙的相似之处。

63
00:04:43,07 --> 00:04:47,29
Being part of that, it just gives me a great feeling

00:04:47,30 --> 00:04:50,24
that we've been able to change the world for the better

65
00:04:50,44 --> 00:04:53,46
A lot of our software helps developing countries.

69
00:05:12,72 --> 00:05:15,43
That's a result of the Free software movements.

70
00:05:15,75 --> 00:05:19,09
And Apache had a big hand in that.
Apache 在其中发挥了巨大的作用

71
00:05:19,10 --> 00:05:20,01
I feel very strongly.
我的感觉非常强烈。

72
00:05:20,27 --> 00:05:24,09
The only thing that will save us as a species from our own internal greed
这是把我们从内心贪婪

73
00:05:24,44 --> 00:05:29,18
and hatred and the distance that we put between human hearts.

And I occasionally I'm chided because I am very sensitive person and have thin skin.
有时大家责备我敏感、脸皮薄

75
00:05:34,10 --> 00:05:37,09
And they say, you need thicker skin.

76
00:05:37,35 --> 00:05:41,09
Now thicker skin puts more distance between human hearts.
现在 ，厚脸皮让大家更生疏了

77
00:05:41,35 --> 00:05:44,38
It allows more space for “not like me”.
让大家更讨厌“我”

78
00:05:44,62 --> 00:05:47,84
It allows more space for “us versus them”.
在“我们“与“他们”之间筑就了一面墙

79
00:05:48,05 --> 00:05:54,01
And that will be our undoing, not just as technologists but as a species.
而这将是我们的败笔，不仅仅是作为技术专家，更是作为一个物种。

80
00:05:54,36 --> 00:05:59,86
And we are at a crucial point in our evolution, I believe,
而我相信，我们正处于进化的关键时刻，

81
00:06:00,02 --> 00:06:04,13
where we need to start caring more about each other and less about profit.

00:06:15,60 --> 00:06:18,61
that gives us the opportunity to have a place

86
00:06:18,69 --> 00:06:23,41
where people can be passionate about solving other people's problems.
让人们在这里可以满怀激情地去解决其他人的问题。

87
00:06:23,57 --> 00:06:28,56
That is one element of good empathy.
