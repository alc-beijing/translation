1
00:00:04,90 --> 00:00:09,89
Bet somebody that they've used Apache software within the last hour.
跟人打赌说他们在过去一个小时内用过Apache的软件

2
00:00:10,00 --> 00:00:15,00
And they have, they have. Because not only are particular projects

3
00:00:15,07 --> 00:00:20,06
particularly widespread, but the spread of projects is enormous.
传播的特别广，而是所有项目都有着巨大的传播面。

4
00:00:20,10 --> 00:00:25,63
And so for instance, if they've used a credit card,
举例来说，如果他们用过信用卡，

00:00:25,94 --> 00:00:31,09
if they've used television, if they've used a web browser, they've used a laptop.
如果他们用过电视，如果他们用过网页浏览器，或者用过笔记本

6
00:00:31,17 --> 00:00:34,69
It's almost certain that they've used some Apache software,
那么他们几乎必定用过Apache的软件，

7
00:00:35,04 --> 00:00:39,69
not knowing it, not necessarily seeing it.
在不自知，也不一定了解的情况下。

8
00:00:39,82 --> 00:00:41,38
But it's almost certainly there.

9
00:00:41,64 --> 00:00:45,06
And it's unless you've been asleep for the last eight hours,

00:00:45,21 --> 00:00:48,86
it's really, really hard to go in a modern technological sense,

11
00:00:49,10 --> 00:00:54,09
more than just a short period of time without using some Apache software.

12
00:00:54,28 --> 00:00:57,26
Why do we give it away? Because it is what we do.
我们为什么将他们“拱手送人”？因为这就是我们要做的。

13
00:00:57,40 --> 00:01:02,39
because the impact of open source is that openness.

而社会中唯一认可的成功因素就是我的公司能挣多少钱。

17
00:01:23,12 --> 00:01:26,91
I think the ASF has proven that even without making money,

18
00:01:27,22 --> 00:01:33,53
we did have a humongous impact in the way which the world runs.
我们同样可以对世界运行的方式产生巨大的影响。

19
00:01:33,82 --> 00:01:35,69

The community is far more important than the code.

23
00:01:46,35 --> 00:01:49,03
The code will survive whether or not the community does.

24
00:01:49,04 --> 00:01:51,93
But it won't get any better or be enriched.

00:01:57,37 --> 00:01:59,44
One of the things we're seeing nowadays

并进军到政府、公司企业、重工业、工厂、机械领域中。
